# Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to use supervised learning techniques in order find donors for a fictious charity (CharityML). It was undertaken as part of Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning nanodegree program.

## Project Work
The following steps were undertaken in order to find appropriate donors:
1. Explore the data
2. Prepare the data:
    - Transform Skewed Continuous Features
    - Normalize Numerical Features
    - Preprocess Data (encoding)
    - Shuffle and Split Data
3. Apply and Evaluate the Preformance of Various Models:
    - Naive Predictor
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boost
    - Support Vector Machine
4. Analyze Feature Selection 

### Installation Instructions

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries to be installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

All project work has been conducted in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. This file requires `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset be installed in the same directory as `finding_donors.ipynb` in order to run properly.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
